# Device Tracking Dashboard - Demo Guide

## 🎯 Current Status

Your GPS tracking system has been successfully integrated with cross-platform device monitoring! 

## 🚀 What's Working Now

### Frontend Dashboard (http://localhost:3000)
- ✅ **Main Dashboard**: Shows overview stats, map view, and device list
- ✅ **Device Monitoring Panel**: New integrated panel for managing all device types
- ✅ **Device Admin Dialog**: Modal for sending messages, locking screens, and executing commands
- ✅ **Real-time Mock Data**: Simulated GPS movement and device updates
- ✅ **Dark/Light Mode**: Theme switching
- ✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile browsers

### Device Types Supported
1. **GPS Trackers** (vehicles): Hardware-based tracking devices
2. **Desktop Computers**: Python agent for Windows/macOS/Linux
3. **Mobile Devices**: React Native app for Android/iOS

### Admin Features
- 📱 **Send Messages**: Pop-up messages on target devices
- 🔒 **Screen Lock**: Remotely lock device screens
- ⚡ **Execute Commands**: Run remote commands (with security restrictions)
- 📍 **Real-time Location**: Live location tracking for all device types
- 📊 **Device Stats**: Battery, signal strength, last seen status

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### 1. View the Dashboard
```bash
# Frontend is already running at:
http://localhost:3000
```

### 2. Explore Features
- Check out the **Device Management** section (newly added)
- Click on any device to see the **Device Admin Dialog**
- Try the different tabs: Send Message, Lock Screen, Execute Command, Device Info
- Toggle between light and dark modes

### 3. Test Device Agents (Optional)

#### Python Desktop Agent:
```bash
cd "/Users/new/Tracking QRCode/device-agents/desktop"
pip install -r requirements.txt
python device_agent.py
```

#### React Native Mobile App:
```bash
cd "/Users/new/Tracking QRCode/device-agents/mobile"
npm install
npx expo start
```

## 🔧 Backend Setup (For Full Functionality)

To enable real device communication, you'll need MongoDB running:

```bash
# Install MongoDB (macOS)
brew install mongodb-community
brew services start mongodb-community

# Then restart the backend
npm run server:dev
```
